# Network Traffic Analyzer

This is a simple and experimental network traffic analyzer developed as a mini-project during my 3rd year, 1st semester in college.

## Project Description

This project utilizes the `scapy` library in Python to capture and analyze network packets. It provides basic functionalities for:

- Capturing packets on a specified network interface.
- Identifying different network protocols.
- Counting the number of packets per protocol.
- Calculating the total bytes transferred per protocol.
- Performing basic statistical analysis on captured traffic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scapy library
- matplotlib library
- defaultdict (from collections)

You can install the required Python libraries using pip.
